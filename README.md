# Bet101

A full stack JavaScript application for sports betting beginners. Bet101 allows you to bet on real games using fake money.

## Why I built this

I love sports, and I've always been interested in the idea of betting on sporting events. However, I never really enjoyed the idea of losing my own money. I looked around for an
easy to use, and beginner friendly, app that would allow users to try betting in a risk free way. I didn't find anything. So I built Bet101 for people who want to try betting on real games without the risk of losing real money.
